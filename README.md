# Guidelines👍:
Before pushing code please go through our guidelines:
1. Always push the code in the specified folder.
2. Mention proper name for the code before making PR.
3. Repetetive Pull Requests with same code in the same language won't be counted and will be marked as spam.
4. If you want to push the code in some other language which is not present in this repo, make a seperate folder with language name and then push it. 
5. Explain your code with proper comments along with problem statement(especially for DSA). It's better if you can write time and space complexities.
